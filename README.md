# 5th Thesis Defense

This is the presentation I made for my 5th year master's thesis defense at IISER, Pune. Feel free to have a look at it.

Due to a limitation with Slidev, I can not build out a presenter view yet. However, my speaker notes are available in the `slides.md` file in their full glory.

Made using [Slidev](https://sli.dev).
